# Physics

Physics homework mode currently supporting n-dimensional electric fields for a subset of  IVC PHYS 4B homework problems

<br>Planning on adding more useful features as the class progresses

## Features
Points, Charged Particles, Electric Fields. See Docstrings and tests for details and examples

I'm currently using Scrips.py to experiment with graphing functions


## TODO: 
- Graphing electric fields with vectors 
- Add support for Disks, Rings, and Rods

## Contributors: 
- Please branch to add more features so you can test without breaking what's here
```angular2
git checkout -b <new-feature-branch>
```
